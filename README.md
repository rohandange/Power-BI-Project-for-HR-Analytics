## Power BI Project: HR Analytics Dashboard for Employee Performance and Retention

This Power BI project aims to help organizations improve **employee performance** and **employee retention** by providing a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard. The dashboard provides key insights into employee data, attrition rates, demographics, and other critical HR metrics. By visualizing employee-related data, HR teams can make data-driven decisions to enhance workforce management.

### **Project Overview**

The project involves building an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** to analyze employee performance, retention, and attrition. The following steps were involved in creating the dashboard:

1. **Data Preparation and Analysis**
    - **Data Selection**: Initially, an analysis was performed on the dataset using pivot tables in Excel to determine which columns were useful for the analysis and which were not.
    - **Data Import**: The dataset was imported into **Power BI** for further processing and visualization.
    - **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by:
      - Removing empty values, errors, and duplicates.
      - Correcting spelling errors.
      - Ensuring that all columns had the correct data types for analysis.

2. **Key Metrics and Cards Creation**
    - After cleaning the data, **six key cards** were created to display important HR metrics:
      1. **Count of Employees**: Displays the total number of employees in the organization.
      2. **Attrition Count**: Shows the number of employees who have left the company.
      3. **Attrition Rate Percentage**: Calculates the attrition rate, providing insights into employee turnover.
      4. **Average Employee Age**: Displays the average age of employees in the organization.
      5. **Average Employee Salary**: Displays the average salary across employees.
      6. **Average Years at Company**: Displays the average number of years employees have spent in the company.

3. **Visualizing Data**
    - After creating the key metrics, various **charts** were designed to provide deeper insights:
      - **Attrition Count by Education Level**: Visualizes how attrition is distributed across different education levels.
      - **Attrition Count by Age Group**: Shows the distribution of attrition across different age groups.
      - **Attrition Count by Salary Slab**: Displays attrition across different salary ranges.
      - **Attrition Count by Years at Company**: Analyzes how long employees stay at the company before leaving.
    - Additional charts were created to visualize other aspects of the HR data, such as gender and department distribution.

4. **Filtering and Interactivity**
    - The dashboard was made interactive by adding **filters** for:
      - **Gender**: Allows filtering data based on gender to analyze attrition and other metrics.
      - **Department**: Enables filtering based on departments to assess performance and retention within different areas of the organization.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensured the dataset was error-free and formatted correctly for analysis in Power BI.
- **Employee Analytics**: Created key metrics and visualizations that provide insights into employee demographics, retention, and performance.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Incorporated filters to allow HR managers to drill down into specific data points (e.g., gender, department, education level).
- **Attrition Insights**: Focused on analyzing employee attrition and turnover, a critical metric for improving employee retention.

### **Charts and Visualizations**
- **Employee Attrition by Education Level**: Understand how attrition rates vary across education levels, which can inform recruitment and training strategies.
- **Attrition by Age Group**: Provides insights into which age groups are more likely to leave the company, helping HR tailor retention strategies.
- **Attrition by Salary Range**: Analyze if employees in certain salary brackets have a higher rate of attrition.
- **Attrition by Years at Company**: Visualizes how long employees stay with the company before leaving, which can help improve retention policies.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
- **Excel Pivot Tables**: Used initially for analyzing which columns were relevant to the analysis.

### **How to Use**
1. Open the **HR Analytics Dashboard** in Power BI.
2. Explore the key metrics displayed on the **cards** for quick insights into employee data.
3. Use the **filters** to explore data by gender, department, education level, or other demographics.
4. Visualize employee attrition, salary distribution, and average tenure to gain actionable insights into workforce trends.

### **Conclusion**
This **HR Analytics Dashboard** in Power BI is a valuable tool for HR teams to track employee performance, attrition, and retention trends. By providing key metrics and interactive filters, the dashboard enables HR professionals to make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and optimize workforce management strategies.
